Comment on "Nothing But The Beat" by David Guetta
This album is absolute trash. I suppose I get its place in the world, but its not really listenable as an album.

NICE playlist. How much effort did you put into this? I.E. do you think there's much more on Rdio not yet on here? I'd collab if you think there's plenty more out there.

Comment on "A/B Machines" by Sleigh Bells
This song sounds trying to start a car when the engine has been replaced by a fat boom box that requires 24 D batteries. It's a good thing.
